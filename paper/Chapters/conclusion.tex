In the previous chapters, we have seen how ownership, borrowing and mutability work together to provide memory safety and how we write these concepts down in relatively simple semantic rules. We have also proved preservation and progress, to prove memory safety in a more classical way. 

\section{Discussion and future work}
While we have looked at some important concepts of Rust, there is of course many many more to Rust that we did not look at extensively. 

For example, we did not include loops in our very limited language, even though loops have been kept in mind while designing the derivation rules for both the semantics and compile time checker.
