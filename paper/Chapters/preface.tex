%In front of you is the thesis \title. This is the result of a study on the semantics and the type system of the programming language Rust. 

%The topic of this thesis originates from the bachelor courses "Semantics and Correctness" and "Computation Models". For the latter, Sander Hendrix and I did a project on the natural semantics of Rust, mostly concerning the memory safety aspects. This project sparked my interests for describing the semantics of a programming language. 

%The report that we then made formed the basis for this thesis. I would like to thank Sander Hendrix for doing the project together. I want to thank Engelbert Hubbers and Erik Barendsen for their feedback on our project.

%Blahblah

%I hope you read this thesis with the same pleasure I made it with.
